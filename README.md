# Multi-Sensor and Peripherals System Using STM32F407

This project demonstrates the integration of various **sensors**, **displays**, and **communication modules** with the **STM32F407 microcontroller**. All drivers are implemented from scratch without external libraries to provide precise control over each peripheral. The goal is to develop a multi-functional embedded system that collects sensor data, displays it on different screens, and communicates wirelessly or through Ethernet.
